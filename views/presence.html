    <h1>Pusher Presence Channel Code Sample</h1>
    
    <p class="description">
      <a href="https://pusher.com/docs/presence_channels">Presence channels</a> are channels that require authentication, much like private channels. They provide real-time information about other users that are subscribed to the channel. You receive an initial list of users via the <code>pusher:subscription_succeeded</code> event, events when users come online via <code>pusher:member_added</code> and events when users go offline via <code>pusher:member_removed</code>.
    </p>
    
    <p class="use-case">
      The most common use case for Presence channels is to build live user lists within a chat rooms scenario. However, don't let this restrict your use case.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    
    <p class="page-instructions">
      To use this code example, take a look at the source of <a href="https://github.com/pusher-community/gs-pusher-node/tree/master/views/presence.html">views/presence.html</a> and <a href="https://github.com/pusher-community/gs-pusher-node/tree/master/server.js">server.js</a>. Additionally, view the output to the JavaScript console in your browser developer tools.
